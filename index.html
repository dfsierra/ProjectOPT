                  Firstly, its variety of attributes enables us to explore multiple facets of wine composition and
                  quality, providing a broad and detailed perspective. Moreover, its widespread availability facilitates
                  access and comparison with other studies, enriching our analysis. The predominance of continuous
                  variables offers a wealth of data to investigate and model with greater precision. Our personal
                  interest in the world of wine drives us to delve into this dataset, while we find it to be a suitable
                  challenge that allows us to grow and learn without overstretching our current capabilities.</p>

      <ul class="u-align-left u-text u-text-2">
        <li> Fixed Acidity: are non-volatile acids that do not evaporate readily.</li>
        <li>Volatile Acidity: are high acetic acid in wine which leads to an unpleasant vinegar taste.</li>
        <li>Citric Acid: acts as a preservative to increase acidity. When in small quantities, adds freshness and flavor
          to wines.</li>
        <li>Residual Sugar: is the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops. The key is to have a perfect
          balance between sweetness and sourness. It is important to note that wines &gt; 45g/ltrs are sweet.</li>
        <li>Chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine.</li>
        <li>Free Sulfur Dioxide: it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine.</li>
        <li>Total Sulfur Dioxide: is the amount of free + bound forms of SO2</li>
        <li>Density: sweeter wines have a higher density.</li>
        <li>pH: describes the level of acidity on a scale of 0‚Äì14. Most wines are always between 3‚Äì4 on the pH scale.
        </li>
        <li>Alcohol: available in small quantities in wines makes the drinkers sociable.</li>
        <li>Sulphates: a wine additive that contributes to SO2 levels and acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.</li>
        <li>Quality: which is the output variable/predictor</li>

                  influenced by various chemical and physical variables. In this hypothesis, we propose that certain
                  wine characteristics, such as alcohol content, volatile acidity, pH, and levels of citric acid, have a
                  significant influence on the perceived quality of wine. Specifically, we suggest that wine quality
                  will be higher when alcohol content falls within a specific and optimal range, volatile acidity
                  remains at low levels, pH is balanced within a certain interval, and citric acid levels provide a
                  sense of freshness without dominating the flavor profile. This hypothesis implies that when modeling
                  wine quality, these variables should be considered as key predictors, and their impact on quality is
                  expected to be evident through statistical analysis and the performance of the

              Estimation Objectives</h3>
            <ul class="u-text u-text-3">
              <li>The main objective of the analysis has been to develop a reliable predictive model estimating the
                quality of red wine based on its chemical properties. Wine quality, serving as the dependent variable,
                has been assessed and predicted through a set of quantifiable independent variables measured for each
                wine sample.</li>
              <li>The correlation matrix suggests that certain variables exert a greater influence on quality than
                others. Notably, a significant negative correlation between volatile acidity and quality indicates that
                wines with lower volatile acidity tend to exhibit better quality. Conversely, a moderate positive
                correlation between alcohol content and quality suggests that wines with higher alcohol content are
                better regarded.</li>
              <li>From these findings, specific objectives for the analysis have been established:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Identify Significant Variables: Determine the independent variables demonstrating statistically
                  significant relationships with wine quality, suitable for inclusion in the predictive model.</li>
                <li>Understand the Nature of Relationships: Investigate whether relationships between variables and wine
                  quality are linear or suggest more complex patterns, potentially necessitating nonlinear models or new
                  derived variables.</li>
                <li>Predictive Modeling: Utilize insights into variable relationships to construct a precise model
                  capable of not only accurately predicting wine quality but also elucidating the influence of each
                  chemical characteristic on quality perception.</li>
                <li>Rigorous Model Evaluation: Ensure the model's ability to generalize to new data, employing
                  appropriate validation techniques to prevent overfitting.</li>

            <ul class="u-text u-text-7">
              <li>We choose all columns of the dataframe except our output variable "Quality" as inputs to our model.
              </li>
              <code>X = df.drop('quality', axis=1)</code>
              <br><br>
              <li>A binarization process was performed on the 'quality' variable of the dataset so that the expected
                data would not be so dispersed and thus expect one prediction option or another. This was done by taking
                the values of this variable and if they were greater than or equal to 6, the quality was categorized as
                "good", otherwise as "bad".</li>
              <code>Y =  df['quality'].apply(lambda y_value: "Good" if y_value >= 6 else "Bad")</code>
              <br><br>
              <li>We have used the technique of splitting data into training and testing. This involves dividing our
                data set into two parts: one part is used to train the model (training set) and the other part is used
                to evaluate the performance of the trained model (test set). This last part corresponds to 30% of the
                data.</li>

            <p>Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict the probability that an instance belongs 
              to a particular class. It's called "logistic" regression because it uses the logistic function to model the relationship 
              between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (the binary outcome).</p>

            <ul class="u-text u-text-5">
              <li>Logistic Regression coefficients are easily interpretable, allowing you to understand how each
                characteristic contributes to the classification of wine quality as "good" or "bad". This provides
                valuable insights into which characteristics are most important in determining wine quality.</li>
              <li>In terms of complexity, Logistic Regression is computationally efficient and can handle large data
                sets quickly and efficiently. This is beneficial when working with a large number of observations and
                characteristics.</li>
              <li>Since we have binarized the wine quality variable to convert the problem into a binary (good/bad)
                classification, Logistic Regression is a natural choice for this type of problem.</li>
              <li>Logistic Regression can use regularization techniques, such as L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge)
                regularization, to avoid overfitting and improve the generalization of our model. This is useful when
                working with features that may be redundant.</li>

            <p>Metrics obtained from a single dataset in a machine learning model may not be indicative of its real-world
            performance on unseen data. This is because the model might have overfit or learned specific features of
            that particular dataset, leading to biased evaluation.</p>
            <p>Cross-validation is a crucial technique that addresses this issue by splitting the dataset into multiple
            partitions and performing multiple iterations of training and evaluation. This allows us to assess the
            model's performance on different subsets of data and calculate more robust and generalizable evaluation
            metrics. By averaging the metrics across multiple cross-validation runs, we obtain a more reliable estimate
            of the model's performance on new and unseen data.</p>

              Preliminary conclusions on the first model</h3>
            <ul class="u-text u-text-9">
              <li>The logistic regression model has exhibited notably satisfactory performance, yielding a score of
                <strong>75%</strong>. This result suggests the model's capability to account for a considerable proportion of
                variability in wine quality.</li>
              <p></p>
              <li>A cross-validation strategy with an 70-30 split has been implemented to evaluate the model's
                generalization ability. Results indicate the model's adequacy in generalizing to new data, implying
                minimal risk of significant overfitting.</li>
              <p></p>
              <li>Accuracy (Around 74%): Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances (both "good" and "bad" wines) among all instances. An accuracy of around 74% indicates that the model correctly classifies 74% of all wines (both good and bad). 
                This suggests that the model performs moderately well in classifying wines into their correct categories.</li>
              <p></p>
              <li>Precision (Good wines around 76%, Bad wines around 72%): Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted "good" (or "bad") instances among all instances predicted as "good" (or "bad") by the model. 
                A precision of 76% for good wines means that when the model predicts a wine as good, it is correct 76% of the time. Similarly, a precision of 72% for bad wines indicates that when the model predicts a wine as bad, it is correct 72% of the time. 
                This suggests that the model is reasonably good at avoiding false positives in both categories.</li>
              <p></p>
              <li>Recall (Good wines around 75%, Bad wines around 73%): Recall measures the proportion of correctly predicted "good" (or "bad") instances among all actual "good" (or "bad") instances.
                A recall of 75% for good wines means that the model correctly identifies 75% of all actual good wines.
                For bad wines, a recall of 73% means that the model correctly identifies 73% of all actual bad wines. 
                These recall values indicate that the model is capturing a significant portion of relevant instances in both categories.</li>
              <p></p>
              <li>F1 Score (Good wines around 76%, Bad wines around 72%): The F1 score indicates a balance between precision and recall.
                   An F1 score of 76% for good wines and 72% for bad wines suggests that the model achieves a good balance between identifying relevant instances (precision) and capturing all relevant instances (recall) for both categories. These scores are relatively high, indicating overall good performance.</li>
              <p></p>
              <li> In conclusion, while the model's F1 scores are high, indicating good overall performance, the relatively balanced precision and recall values for both good and bad wines suggest that the model is performing well in identifying and capturing relevant instances for both categories. </li>

              <li>Because of its ability to learn nonlinear representations of data, the MLP can model complex relationships between input features and output labels. This makes it suitable for a wide range of machine learning problems.</li>
              <li>In terms of complexity, MLPs can handle large and complex datasets due to their ability to learn hierarchical
                representations of features. Though training may be more computationally intensive than logistic regression, 
                advances in hardware and algorithms have improved their efficiency.</li>
              <li>The MLP can learn complex patterns in data, making it useful for problems where the relationships between input features and output labels are not obvious or are highly interconnected.</li>

              Preliminary conclusions on the second model</h3>
              <p>The analysis of the machine learning model's performance metrics for wine quality prediction reveals significant findings and potential areas for improvement.</p>
            <ul class="u-text u-text-9">
              <li>The model's accuracy, with a mean close to <strong>87%</strong> and low dispersion, indicates a consistent overall performance. However, high accuracy should not be interpreted as an indication of optimal performance in all facets of classification.</li>
              <li>The model's precision, although moderate with a main peak around <strong>60%</strong>, suggests a tendency to misclassify a considerable number of "Bad" quality wines as "Good". This phenomenon, known as false positives, can impact confidence in the model's predictions.
                The model's Recall, with a pronounced peak near <strong>0%</strong>, indicates that the model has significant difficulties in correctly identifying all "Good" quality wines. This high rate of false negatives can have negative consequences if the accurate identification of these wines is important.
                </li>
                <li>Finally, the F1-score, a metric that combines precision and recall, exhibits a bimodal shape, suggesting that the model's performance in terms of the balance between precision and recall is not uniform and could be influenced by various factors. The bimodal shape and dispersion suggest the need for further analysis and optimization of the model to achieve a better balance between precision and recall.</li>

            <h3 class="u-text u-text-8 u-text-center" style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; color: #602234;">
              Comparison between both models</h3>
              <p>Comparing the Logistic Regression model with the second one based on MLP Neural Networks, we can appreciate that the first one showed less dispersion and more marked trends in its metrics, observing in most of them normal distributions with a clear mode, and in general, where the greater number of data is grouped, the results are higher, while in the second one a greater dispersion is observed and in metrics such as the F1 score it is even a bimodal distribution. 
              </p>
              <p>For both models, the Accuracy is very similar, around 0.6, and the Sensitivity or Recall is low, but the peak in the second model is at 0. However, due to its dispersion, it is observed that this peak is not far from the rest of the values, with a large number of records grouped between 0.0 and 0.3, while in the first model it is around 0.25. Now, associating both metrics, we can understand that the F1 score is low for both cases because Precision and Recall are also low, suggesting that the model has difficulties in identifying really good wines.
